- [ ] Improve layout and give fixed width to the input field
- [ ] Improve layout cap list at end of screen
- [ ] "Shift" list when moving past the end of the screen

### rmenu_launch
- [ ] Make script generic instead of specific to my machine

### history
- [ ] Combine from two binaries into one with two commands
- [ ] Improve history sorting to account for "time since selected"
