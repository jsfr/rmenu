## To Do

### rmenu
- [ ] Get rid of `.clone` calls in `ui.rs`
- [ ] Get rid of "counter" widget used to ensure the UI is updated when switching selection
- [ ] Introduce fuzzy search
- [ ] Introduce option to make search case-sensitive
- [ ] Introduce option to close rmenu when losing focus
- [ ] Improve layout and give fixed width to the input field
- [ ] Improve layout and add more padding between options + cap list at end of screen

### rmenu_launch
- [ ] Make script generic instead of specific to my machine

### history
- [ ] Combine from two binaries into one with two commands
- [ ] Improve history sorting to account for "time since selected"
